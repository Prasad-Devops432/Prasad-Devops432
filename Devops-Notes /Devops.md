# üöÄ What Is DevOps?

**DevOps** is a combination of two words:  
- **Dev** = Development (writing code, building apps)  
- **Ops** = Operations (deploying, managing servers, monitoring apps)

DevOps is a **culture and set of practices** that bring together software developers and IT operations teams to **build, test, and release software faster and more reliably**.

## üß† Why DevOps?

Before DevOps, developers would write code and "throw it over the wall" to operations teams, who would deploy and maintain it. This caused delays, miscommunication, and bugs.

**DevOps solves this by:**
- Automating repetitive tasks  
- Improving collaboration between teams  
- Making deployments faster and safer  
- Reducing downtime and errors

## üè¢ Real-World Analogy

Imagine a **restaurant kitchen**:

- **Chefs (Developers)** cook the food (write code)  
- **Waiters (Operations)** deliver the food to customers (deploy apps)

If chefs and waiters don‚Äôt talk, orders get messed up.  
DevOps is like having a **shared system** where both work together, using tools to track orders, prep food faster, and serve customers smoothly.

## üì¶ Real-World Examples

### 1. Netflix
- Deploys updates **hundreds of times a day**
- Uses DevOps to test and release changes **without interrupting streaming**

### 2. Amazon
- Constantly updates its shopping platform
- DevOps helps scale during big events like **Prime Day** with zero downtime

### 3. Your Personal Blog
- You push code to GitHub  
- Jenkins automatically tests and deploys it  
- Monitoring tools alert you if something breaks
