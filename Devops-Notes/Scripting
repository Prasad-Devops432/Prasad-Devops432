# 🖋️ What is Scripting?

## 📍 Definition
**Scripting** is the process of writing small programs — called **scripts** — that automate tasks, control other software, or make systems behave in a certain way.  
A **scripting language** is a type of programming language that is usually **interpreted** (run directly) rather than compiled into machine code.

## 🔄 How It Works
- You write a set of instructions in a scripting language (e.g., Python, Bash, JavaScript).
- The script is run by an **interpreter** (e.g., Python interpreter, Bash shell, browser JavaScript engine).
- The script automates a process or performs a task without needing manual steps.

## 🏢 Real-World Analogy
Think of scripting like **writing a recipe**:
- The recipe (script) tells the cook (computer) exactly what steps to follow.
- You don’t need to explain *how* to cook from scratch every time — you just follow the written steps.

## 📦 Examples of Scripting in Action

### 1. **Automation**
- **Example:** A Bash script that backs up files every night.
```bash
#!/bin/bash
tar -czf backup.tar.gz /home/user/documents
